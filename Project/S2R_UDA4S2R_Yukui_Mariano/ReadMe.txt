1. Datasets preparation:
Dataset can be download from google drive link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Occ_l2DxQ_sB7KN7pHsPEngSc8wEOaJh?usp=sharing
And oginzed as follow structure:
dataset
           |____mnist
           |	          |____trainset
           |              |____testset
           |____svhn (same structure as mnist)
           |____sgan-svhn
           |____mnist-m

2. Fake svhn generate:
Use code folder: MN-SV
sgan-svhn is a pregenerate dataset by semi-unsupervised GAN.

3. UDA methods:
RevGrad folder for RevGrad method
VAE-GAN folder for VAE-GAN method
